Since 2020, I had always been a loyal Fedora user.
Fedora is always providing the latest technologies, features and experience to users,
also provides btrfs support I love which is not available in the Red Hat kernel.

But since Nov 2024, I was motivated by **derivation from configuration** in NixOS.

My NixOS configuration is available at [github.com/jellyterra/nixos-config](https://github.com/jellyterra/nixos-config).
It may help you get started and set your NixOS up.

## This tutorial will help configure ...

- Nix binary cache mirror/substituter setup.
- Network and Firewall.
- Filesystem mounting.
- System-wide packages and libraries.
- Upgrade NixOS software and release.
- Desktop environment with input method.
- Hardware acceleration.
- Build the FHS environment for running **non-Nix-compatible** or ***generic-linux*** programs.

## What do we really need from Nix and NixOS?

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- Reproducible environment.
- Atomic update.
- Community-maintained packages, including proprietary software.

> ***Nix is very valuable for environment reproduction in academic papers.***
>
> I strongly recommend researchers to take Nix as their environment manager.
> They are almost environmental reproducible at least for the projects that provides Nix configuration.
>
> ***It's an ideal solution for the [Replication Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis) at the software level in the computer science related works.***

## What are still lacking in NixOS?

- There is no FHS environment available in default.
- Enterprise production environment with high security requirement.
    - **Self-signed Secure Boot** is not supported yet.
      Cannot defense the **[Evil Maid Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_maid_attack)**.
    - **Mandatory Access Control** (e.g. **SELinux** / **AppArmor**) is not supported yet.
    - Many packages in Nixpkgs have not been audited for security.

## When you need not NixOS?

- Nix is enough to manage packages and environments.
- Got tired with new tools.
- Having OS-security obsession.
- Enjoying configuring your system manually instead of deriving from declarative configuration.
- Just wanting to f-uck it.

> [!TIP]
>
> For individual or enterprise users who want pure FHS in production environment:
> Ansible, Ignition and Terraform/OpenTofu might be more suitable choices rather than Nix.

# The Eden

Installation of one distro is super easy.
But the trouble appears around us is mostly the post-installation configuration and maintenance.

Ofc, NixOS certainly provides the best introduction of them.

NixOS is configured via generating by the `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix`.

## Graphical or manual installation

[Official manual](https://nixos.org/manual/nixos/stable/) is the best guideline.
The process is simple. You can do it yourself.

I choose **KDE** on my workstation.

## Pre-installation mirror setup

If the connection to `cache.nixos.org` is slow.
You can prepend mirrors in `/etc/nix/nix.conf`.

```shell
ll /etc/nix/nix.conf
```

```
nix.conf -> /etc/static/nix/nix.conf
```

```sh
# Backup
cp /etc/nix/nix.conf .../nix.conf
# Remove symlink.
rm /etc/nix/nix.conf
# Copy back.
cp .../nix.conf /etc/nix/nix.conf
# Modify.
nano /etc/nix/nix.conf
```

```
# Prepend the mirror before cache.nixos.org
substituters = https://mirror.sjtu.edu.cn/nix-channels/store https://cache.nixos.org/
```

## Install packages on NixOS

```shell
# Deprecated. Not recommended.
nix-env -i
```

```nix
# /etc/nixos/configuration.nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  # Correct way.
];
```

```shell
# Apply changes to one new generation and switch to it.
nixos-rebuild switch
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> In NixOS, everything is derived from the Nix expressions in the NixOS configuration file.
> The user shouldn't edit the generated configuration files, or modify software packages.
> Every change should be done by editing the NixOS configuration file in Nix language,
> then switch to the new generation has been built.

# Build the NixOS Environment with FHS-Compatibility

NixOS is designed to be non-FHS.
They choose to let the users configure the FHS environment by themselves.
Rather than making one FHS-compatible default preset.

All system-wide binaries and libraries will be symlinked to `/run/current-system/sw` after `nix-rebuild switch`.
Almost like another system root in FHS.

For users who prefer FHS, there are many ways to build one FHS-compatible environment.
One of them is `buildFHSEnv`, but we will not take this.

In the examples we'll see next, we'll try build it in system-wide environment through one more elegant way.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The changes are based on the configuration.nix after the NixOS installation.
> Most settings are well-documented in comment blocks and the NixOS Wiki.

## Nix and NixOS

```nix
nix.settings.substituters = lib.mkBefore [ "https://mirror.sjtu.edu.cn/nix-channels/store" ];

nixpkgs.config.allowUnfree = true;

system.stateVersion = "24.11";

systemd.targets = {
  sleep.enable = false;
  suspend.enable = false;
  hibernation.enable = false;
  hybrid-sleep.enable = false;
};
```

## [Filesystems](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Filesystems)

`nixos-generate-config` would automatically detect the partitions on the disks and generate options for you and save to `hardware-configuration.nix`.

Use `lib.mkForce` to override them with your changes.

Example:

```nix
fileSystems."/home" = {
  device = "/dev/nvme0n1p2";
  fsType = "btrfs";
  options = [ "compress=zstd:3" "nosuid" "subvol=@/home" ];
};

fileSystems."/opt" = {
  device = "/dev/disk/by-uuid/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000";
  fsType = "btrfs";
  options = [ "compress=zstd:3" "nosuid" "subvol=@/opt" ];
};

fileSystems."/external" = lib.mkForce {
  device = "/dev/sda";
  fsType = "xfs";
  options = [ "nofail" "noexec" ];
};
```

## [Networking](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Networking)

Choose one from the solutions below.

### Direct

```nix
networking = {
  nameservers = [ "1.1.1.1" ];
  # If using dhcpcd:
  dhcpcd.extraConfig = "nohook resolv.conf";
  # If using NetworkManager:
  networkmanager.dns = "none";
}
```

### Local DNS Resolver - [systemd-resolved](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Systemd-resolved)

```nix
services.resolved = {
  enable = true;
  fallbackDns = [ "1.1.1.1" ];
};
```

### [Firewall](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Firewall)

```nix
networking.firewall = {
  enable = true;
  allowedTCPPorts = [];
};
```

## nix-ld

When running FHS-based generic-linux programs, the `ld` reports the program is not compatible with NixOS.
That's the time we need `nix-ld` to locate and load the libraries from various packages and paths.

***You really need it!***

```nix
programs.nix-ld.enable = true;
programs.nix-ld.libraries = with pkgs; [
  # Add the packages here.
  bubblewrap
  busybox
  gcc
  openssl
  pkg-config
  wineWowPackages.staging
  libxcrypt-legacy
];
```

Now the programs are able to be running with the libraries.

For users who want running IntelliJ IDEA, fill the dependencies to `nix-ld.libraries`.
Refer to [NixOS Wiki for JetBrains Tools](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Jetbrains_Tools).

## System-wide packages

```nix
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  # Add the packages here.

  (chromium.override {
    enableWideVine = true;
    commandLineArgs = [
      "--enable-wayland-ime"
      "--enable-features=UseOzonePlatform,ScrollableTabStrip:minTabWidth/140"
      "--ozone-platform-hint=wayland"
    ];
  })

] ++ config.programs.nix-ld.libraries;
```

> [!TIP]
>
> It's recommended to add all the packages have to be overridden to <environment.systemPackages>. And others to <nix-ld.libraries>.

## Environment variables

Some Nix options do have default value.
I usually choose to override them.
It's troublesome to me to prepend or append them.

```nix
environment.variables = rec {
  # NOTE: You may have to prepend the default value or nobody knows what problem will be caused.
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH = lib.mkForce (with pkgs; lib.makeLibraryPath config.programs.nix-ld.libraries);

  # For Chromium users.
  GOOGLE_API_KEY = "";
  GOOGLE_DEFAULT_CLIENT_ID = "";
  GOOGLE_DEFAULT_CLIENT_SECRET = "";
};
```

## bashrc

```nix
programs.bash.shellInit = ''

# Shell script here.
alias la='ls -a'

''
```

## PAM

### Fingerprint

```nix
services.fprintd.enable = true;
security.pam.services.login.fprintAuth = lib.mkForce true;
```

## Udev Rules

```nix
services.udev.extraRules = ''

# CH340
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="1a86", ATTR{idProduct}=="7522", GROUP="plugdev", MODE:="0666"

''; }
```

## Desktop Environment

These are configured by NixOS installer with KDE installed chosen by user:

- Audio
- Internationalization
- Localization

### Fonts

```nix
fonts.packages = with pkgs; [
  noto-fonts
  noto-fonts-cjk-sans
  noto-fonts-emoji
];
```

### Flatpak

```nix
services.flatpak.enable = true;
```

### GDM & Plasma 6

```nix
services.xserver = {
  enable = true;
  displayManager.gdm = {
    enable = true;
    wayland = true;
  };
  xkb = {
    layout = "us";
    variant = "";
  };
};

services.desktopManager.plasma6.enable = true;
```

### Input Method

```nix
i18n.inputMethod = {
  enable = true;
  type = "fcitx5";
  fcitx5.waylandFrontend = true;
  fcitx5.addons = with pkgs; [
    fcitx5-chinese-addons
  ];
};
```

Choose **Fcitx 5** in **Settings -> Keyboard -> Virtual Keyboard** to launch the Fcitx on session start.

### Hardware Acceleration

```nix
hardware.graphics = {
  enable = true;
  extraPackages = with pkgs; [
    # Intel Hardware Codec
    vpl-gpu-rt
  ];
};
```

# Maintenance

## Update packages

```shell
nix-channel --update
nixos-rebuild switch --upgrade-all
```

## Upgrade to newer NixOS release

```nix
system.stateVersion = "24.11";
```

```shell
nix-channel --add https://nixos.org/channels/24.11 nixos
nix-channel --update
nixos-rebuild boot --upgrade-all
```

## Garbage collection

After the generation whatever caused by installation, configuration or upgrade.
Let Nix remove **unused packages** and **boot entries** to free storage space.

```shell
# Delete all.
nix-collect-garbage --delete-old

# Delete expired only.
nix-collect-garbage --delete-older-than 7d
```

> [!CAUTION]
>
> You will be unable to roll back to the deleted generations and boot entries. They are GONE!

# All Done!

Now you've got your NixOS configuration and can be re-used on other machines!

Install and run toolchains, IDEs and EDAs. Rust-up, Julia-up, JetBrains IDEA/CLion, Xilinx Vivado and more things.
These FHS-based programs are now able to be running on your system.

Append missing dependencies required by the programs to `programs.nix-ld.libraries`.
No third-party source such as Nixpkgs needed.

If you want, push your NixOS configuration to one Git repo!

> Do not forget to do sensitive data redaction when you share the configuration.
