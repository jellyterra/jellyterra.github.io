### NOTE for lazy person: I've packed the [ROM package](https://github.com/jellyterra/bpi-f3-archlinux/releases) for eMMC with

- Kernel `6.1.15` version: Build the images as following by yourself if you want newer.
- `/boot/bianbu.bmp` is the boot splash image of ArchLinux
- `/etc/resolve.conf` with `nameserver 1.1.1.1`
- `/etc/systemd/network/0-end.network` with DHCP configuration set up

# Build the images by yourself

[Felix Yan's wiki](https://wiki.felixc.at/linux_risc-v) about the ArchLinux RISC-V porting.

[postmarketOS Wiki](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Banana_Pi_BPI-F3_(bananapi-bpi-f3)) about Banana Pi F3 with Spacemit K1 SoC.

Banana Pi forum question about [booting with root filesystem on NVMe](https://forum.banana-pi.org/t/how-to-boot-through-nvme/18316/10).

## Make the ext4 rootfs image

Download the ArchLinux RISC-V porting rootfs archive [here](https://archriscv.felixc.at/images/).

```shell
# Allocate image file. Count defined by your eMMC free size.
dd if=/dev/zero of=rootfs.ext4 bs=1G count=14

# Copy file system tree.
mkfs.ext4 rootfs.ext4
mount rootfs.ext4 /mnt
cp -rp .../archriscv/* /mnt/
umount /mnt
```

### Modify the fstab

The rootfs may will be mounted as read-only due to filesystem check.
If it happens, remount it with option `-o rw,remount` then modify the fstab.

```
/dev/mmcblk2p5 /boot ext4 defaults,nofail 0 0
/dev/mmcblk2p6 /     ext4 defaults,rw     0 0
```

### Replace boot splash image (optional)

The splash image file is in the BMP bitmap format by Microsoft and location specified by the variable defined under
U-Boot: `splashfile` which is usually `bianbu.bmp` on `bootfs.ext4`.

## Fetch the U-Boot and kernel

Download the Bianbu distro image archive at [archive.spacemit.com](https://archive.spacemit.com/image/k1/version/bianbu/).
I chose [this](https://archive.spacemit.com/image/k1/version/bianbu/v2.2/bianbu-24.04-desktop-k1-v2.2-release-20250430190125.zip).

> [!NOTE]
>
> Different release version has different kernel version.

It looks like:

```
.
├── bootfs.ext4
│     ^ /dev/mmcblk2p5
├── env.bin
├── factory
│        ├── bootinfo_emmc.bin
│        ├── bootinfo_sd.bin
│        ├── bootinfo_spinand.bin
│        ├── bootinfo_spinor.bin
│        └── FSBL.bin
├── fastboot.yaml
├── fw_dynamic.itb
├── genimage.cfg
├── partition_2M.json
├── partition_flash.json
├── partition_universal.json
├── rootfs.ext4
│     ^ /dev/mmcblk2p6: The image to be replaced.
└── u-boot.itb
```

Replace the `rootfs.ext4` with the image you made.

## Kernel modules

Copy all modules under `/lib/modules` from Bianbu's `rootfs.ext4` image to ArchLinux's.

Some Bianbu releases does not contain **kernel modules** such as ***[ btrfs, xfs ]*** in the init ramdisk.
Instead, they are stored on root filesystem.
So you can only use ext4 for your root filesystem unless you build the kernel that with the modules static-linked in.

## U-Boot environment variables

Force U-Boot falling back to prompt by removing SD Card from slot while U-Boot is booting.

```shell
env print -a
```

## Option: Specify the root filesystem such as partition on NVMe

> [!TIP]
>
> Spacemit's firmware does not support boot from NVMe.
> The options are 「eMMC」「SDcard」and「NAND/NOR SPI flash」only.

If you want to specify which partition or device should the kernel mounts as root filesystem, you have to append the lines below before the end of `/boot/env_k1-x.txt`.

```shell
lets_boot=setenv bootargs earlyprintk quiet clk_ignore_unused swiotlb=65536 workqueue.default_affinity_scope=system earlycon=sbi console=ttyS0,115200n8 loglevel=8 rdinit=/init rootwait rootfstype=ext4 root=${ROOT_FS}
autoboot=run lets_boot; run detect_dtb; run loadknl; run loaddtb; run loadramdisk; run start_kernel;
```

Substitute `${ROOT_FS}` with the target partition or device.

- `/dev/mmcblk2p6`
- `/dev/nvme0n1p1`

### Example: Specify the root as `/dev/nvme0n1p1`

The root partition filesystem has to be `ext4` because the initramfs does not contain kernel module for `btrfs`.

The kernel on `/dev/mmcblk2p5` (which is from `bootfs.ext4`) will mount `/dev/nvme0n1p1` as the root filesystem.

## Troubleshooting

Q: The U-Boot env var and boot args does not work on other Bianbu release.

A: For other Bianbu release version, try checking the U-Boot environment variables and the related booting commands and make effective one.

### Help: How to get the boot args?

It's `/proc/cmdline`.

```shell
cat /proc/cmdline
```

### Help: How to inspect U-Boot environment variables so that I can set correct boot args and command sequence?

Make sure your board **can NOT** boot from any boot options so that it will fallback to U-Boot shell.

```
# This command will print all env variables.
==> env print
```

# Choice 1: Flashing to SD Card

Use the [genimage](https://github.com/pengutronix/genimage) to generate sdcard image.

```shell
# Installation, for NixOS user.
nix-shell -p genimage

# Generate image.
cd .../archriscv
ln -s . input
genimage

# Write to the microSD.
dd if=./images/...-sdcard.img of=/dev/mmcblk2 bs=4096 status=progress
```

# Choice 2: Flashing to eMMC

The SoC will load one program, for processing packets from the host about firmware flashing.

The tool is flashing the target device via executing **fastboot** commands.
You may have heard of it on Android.

Requires `fastboot` CLI utility.

### Flash tool

The board supports flashing firmware in *fastboot* mode.

The utilities below are required:

```
fastboot
```

## Connect to the board

Connect USB port on the board to your computer. It will show as a **DFU** device, and turn to
`U-Boot USB download gadget` while flashing.

```shell
lsusb
```

```
Bus 001 Device 009: ID 361c:1001 U-Boot USB download gadget
```

### Help: Allow unprivileged users to access the board on DFU mode

Make the users in the group `plugdev` able to access it.

```shell
nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-spacemit.rules
```

```
SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTR{idVendor}=="361c", ATTR{idProduct}=="1001", GROUP="plugdev", MODE:="0660"
```

## Flash images

> [!TIP]
>
> For BPi-F3 board:
> Press and hold the [FDL] and [RST] buttons in order to enter firmware update mode.

```shell
fastboot stage factory/FSBL.bin
fastboot continue
fastboot stage u-boot.itb
fastboot continue
fastboot flash gpt partition_universal.json
fastboot flash bootinfo factory/bootinfo_sd.bin
fastboot flash fsbl factory/FSBL.bin
fastboot flash env env.bin
fastboot flash opensbi fw_dynamic.itb
fastboot flash uboot u-boot.itb
fastboot flash bootfs bootfs.ext4
fastboot flash rootfs rootfs.ext4
```

It takes about 100 seconds when the `rootfs.ext4` image is 2GiB.

# Enjoy!

ArchLinux is now available on your board.

Reset your board.
ArchLinux will boot!

The password of `root` is `archriscv` by [Felix Yan](https://archriscv.felixc.at/).

## Desktop Environment

The graphics performance is poor with `llvmpipe`.

But do not worry about it.

**It's not much better when using hardware acceleration.**

### KDE

pacman -S icu plasma-desktop plasma-nm plasma-pa plasma-workspace plasma-workspace-wallpapers xdg-desktop-portal-kde dolphin kate konsole okular spectacle

# FAQ

## Missing drivers

Official documentation about [building drivers and libraries on Spacemit K1](https://bianbu-linux.spacemit.com/en/).

## About the graphics hardware acceleration

The SoC integrated [Imagination BXE-2-32](https://www.imaginationtech.com/product/img-bxe-2-32/) **without opensource driver yet**.

* [Mesa3D](https://gitee.com/bianbu-linux/mesa3d/)
* [Imagination PowerVR Driver](https://gitee.com/bianbu-linux/img-gpu-powervr/) (properietary)
* [Spacemit MPP library](https://gitee.com/bianbu-linux/mpp/)

I haven't made them working in success after built on ArchLinux.
I gave up discovering this valueless platform.

> [!TIP]
> If somebody has the solution please publish it in the remark area. Thanks!

The Chinese capital *Canyon Bridge Capital* has been the current parent company of *Imagination* since 2017.

The alternative is the software implementation `llvmpipe`.

## About the media hardware codec

Spacemit has designed [their own media API](https://bianbu-linux.spacemit.com/development_guide/media/) for their codec.
They called it *Multi Processing Platform (MPP)*.

They supported this media API in *FFmpeg* and *Gstreamer* on their distro *Bianbu*.
**I really couldn't understand: why didn't they make it VAAPI-compatible?**

## What do I use it for?

It's affording some functionalities of this site with services proxied via Cloudflare Daemon running on it.
Such as [statistics and web traffic analysis](https://github.com/dashanalytics/).
