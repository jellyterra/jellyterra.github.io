The script is originally completed on [May 8, 2024](https://github.com/jellyterra/fedora-secureboot).

This tutorial mainly shown how to protect your boot chain.
You do not need Secure Boot if you'll never meet the **Evil Maid Attack**.

## Why cannot we fully trust GRUB?

The `/boot` is usually not protected. Anyone who can physically access the device can tamper the kernel and `initramfs`.

The GRUB can validate the kernel and `initramfs`, but does not validate its configuration itself.
And signing files under `/boot` is complicated.

## Alternative to Secure Boot

Some NVMe devices support TCG security functions such as Pyrite (controller password) and Opal (on-disk encryption).
Attacker cannot tamper the disk without correct password.

## Unattended boot

Unlock LUKS volume by passphrase stored in TPM.
This [tutorial](https://gist.github.com/jdoss/777e8b52c8d88eb87467935769c98a95) may help.

# Set up

Install dependencies

- dracut
- efitools
- openssl
- sbsigntools
- systemd-boot: EFI stub file is required by **dracut**

```bash
dnf install dracut efitools openssl sbsigntools systemd-boot
```

> [!CAUTION]
>
> Backup your UEFI configuration, ESP and bootloader, have a backup in case the unexpected happens.

## Configure Secure Boot to Custom Mode

> [!NOTE]
>
> It depends on your UEFI firmware.

## Setup under Custom Mode: PK, KEK and DB keys

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Make sure your COMPLETELY understand how the commands operate before acting.

### Generate keypairs

```bash
openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -subj "/CN=PK/"  -keyout PK.key  -out PK.crt  -days 7300 -nodes -sha256
openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -subj "/CN=KEK/" -keyout KEK.key -out KEK.crt -days 7300 -nodes -sha256
openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -subj "/CN=db/"  -keyout db.key  -out db.crt  -days 7300 -nodes -sha256
```

### Translate public keys (certificate) to EFI signature lists

```bash
cert-to-efi-sig-list PK.crt PK.esl
sign-efi-sig-list -k PK.key -c PK.crt PK PK.esl PK.auth

cert-to-efi-sig-list KEK.crt KEK.esl
sign-efi-sig-list -k PK.key -c PK.crt KEK KEK.esl KEK.auth

cert-to-efi-sig-list db.crt db.esl
sign-efi-sig-list -k KEK.key -c KEK.crt db db.esl db.auth
```

### Write PK, KEK, DB public keys into EFI Var

```bash
efi-updatevar -f db.auth db
efi-updatevar -f KEK.auth KEK
efi-updatevar -f PK.auth PK
```

> [!TIP]
>
> Some UEFI firmwares support enrolling PK, KEK, DB public keys in the Setup interface.
> It's recommended if your firmware supports.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Protect your UEFI Setup by admin password to keep SecureBoot truly effective.

> [!WARNING]
>
> The keys can be reset in UEFI Setup. You may not have to back them up.
> But make sure you kept the UEFI Setup password well!

## Packing unified kernel image with dracut

**dracut** is a shell script for generating initramfs/initrd image.
The ```.conf``` files are shell scripts with environment variable definitions inside.

Write the kernel cmdline to ```/etc/dracut.conf.d/cmdline.conf```:

```bash
kernel_cmdline=$(cat /proc/cmdline)
```

**Alternatively**, you can also add the kernel cmdline as an option to dracut.

```bash
dracut --kernel-cmdline $(cat /proc/cmdline)
```

For **x86_64** machines:

```bash
dracut \
    --kernel-cmdline $(cat /proc/cmdline) \
    --uefi-stub /lib/systemd/boot/efi/linuxx64.efi.stub \
    --uefi /boot/efi/EFI/$(uname -r).efi
```

## Sign the UKI

```bash
sbsign --key db.key --cert db.crt --output /boot/efi/EFI/$(uname -r).efi /boot/efi/EFI/$(uname -r).efi
```

## Add boot entry to UEFI for the UKI

```bash
efibootmgr \
    -L "Fedora - $(uname -r)" \
    --loader /boot/efi/EFI/$(uname -r).efi \
    --create
```

## Activate Secure Boot: Standard Mode

Make sure everything is ready.

Reboot and enter UEFI Setup. Set Secure Boot to Standard Mode.

## Check that your Secure Boot settings truly affect

> [!WARNING]
>
> For this step, you have to check manually. It is IMPORTANT!

You can add another EFI executable without valid signature to UEFI.
If it **does not** boot, the Secure Boot does work.

> [!TIP]
>
> Copy /boot to the encrypted partition. Copy them back before update.
> So that you don't need to protect /boot anymore.
