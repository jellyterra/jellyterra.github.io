title: 'Interaction Net is hard, and HVM2 is tough'

Out of curiosity about *Victor Taelin*'s promotion about "the great parallelism"
powered by Interaction Net and his implementation HVM2.
I've tried to understand what the Interaction Net,
and how does it work to work out one program's parallelism and possibilities.

My friend [@imlyzh](https://github.com/imlyzh) advised me on the voice chat tonight:
**do not expect** the Interaction Net, and the implementation -- HVM2
to be practical.

The problems caused by the *shared memory division and utilization* of GPU were mentioned.
However, my understanding of GPU is still shallow.
So I could't deeply understand and describe the specific reasons.

Latency is a difficult problem to solve in parallel computing.
Most computing models that take memory access and communication into the cost.
The cost of communication is much higher than that of computation,
and destroying program locality is a very bad choice,
which will invalidate the cache and cause unacceptable latency by memory accesses.

The latency brought by damaging the program locality is much bigger than the benefit brought by the parallelism.
