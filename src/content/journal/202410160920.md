On Jun 5th this year,
I've thought that if we can analyze all the data dependence/relationship/path of the entire program,
then we can execute the separated dataflows in parallel,
and commit the result at the confluence node of the following dataflow.
I named my implementation that have not done yet, called [Paracell](https://github.com/langvm/paracell).

Recently I started learning about the dataflow architecture after the exploration about Interaction Net and HVM2.
It was a research hotspot in 1970s and early 1980s.
And the [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_architecture) shown that my ideas were studied at that time.

In my thought, the main problems for application of theories are about
the cost by synchronization, memory access, communication latency.
