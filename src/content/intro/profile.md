I am learning and working on:

* Compilers and program analysis
* Digital hardware design
* DIY circuit boards and applications with KiCad
* Infrastructure
* Productivity and automation tools

I have mainly focused on learning hardware architecture and PL theory since 2023.

But my knowledge in these is still shallow. I CRAVE GUIDANCE! **:D**

Life is short. Three twenty of years is not enough to do many things.
I hope my life to be fulfilling and my visions about technologies and society to become true.
