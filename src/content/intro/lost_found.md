Writing about past, is my way of making peace with past self, is a way to comfort myself.

Here are the ideas and repos I've dropped in the past.

Most of them were just fresh ideas and had been only implemented a bit.

The deletions I made in 2019 and 2020 of my past accounts and activities is a great regret for me, which I must to get out from today.

2023 means a lot to me. New domains, fantastic mates, inspiring future ...

**It is a rebirth, a new beginning ...**
