# lost+found

***The less you have, the more you fear losing.***

Writing about past, is my way of making peace with past self, a way to comfort myself.

Here are the ideas and repos I've **dropped** in the past.

Most of them were just ideas and had not been fully implemented.

The deletion of my past accounts and activities is a **great regret** for me, which I must to get out from.

2023 means a lot to me. New domains, fantastic mates, inspiring future ...

***It is a rebirth, a new beginning ...***
