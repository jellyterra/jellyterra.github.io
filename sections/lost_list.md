**2018 On-EasyAccess**<br/>
A **failed** xml-based database Go program that **failed** in a competition held by the city.<br/>
But it is one of the important bonds with the info-tech teacher Zhang in the last semester of my primary school time.

**2018 LangVM Project**, which is different with 2023 [one](https://github.com/langvm/).<br/>
Motivated to create a purely functional high-level VM as an alternative to the JVM,<br/>
and provide native compilation support at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
The thing beyond my mind is: it has similar inspiration and motivation with LLVM's,<br/>
but I didn't know about it that time! [(The last paragraph in Page 3, Preface)](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/songfu/course/spring2018/CS131/llvm.pdf)<br/>
<br/>
As of the time the repository was removed, only an untested interpreter was implemented. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, there is a Chrome offline webpage capture taken in 2019 saved on my cloud drive.<br/>
I uploaded it and can be found [here](https://github.com/jellyterra/jellyterra/tree/main/lost-and-found/).


**2018 Lava, Oops, Cheese etc.**<br/>
VM-level assembly, high-level and even localized programming languages designed for LangVM.<br/>
This is why I bought the "dragon book".<br/>

**2019 Ketchup Graphics**<br/>
A simple graphics engine based on OpenGL.<br/>
This is why I bought the books about OpenGL. But today we should use Vulkan. xD

**2019 Divine Comedy and Reality**<br/>
Make the story and three realms of Divine Comedy into a game.<br/>
I found that I was not able to do it that time -- even will never be.<br/>
**I hope someone/producer can do it.** (for me)<br/>
